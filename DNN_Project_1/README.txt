*** WELCOME TO THE DNN GUIDED PROJECT 1 README FILE ***

To run the Dropout and Deep Ensembles Methods please follow the instructions:

A. DROPOUT METHOD
-- Access the "Dropout_Method" Folder.
-- To see the DNN training code, open "cartpole_train_dnn.py".
-- To run the trained model, open and run "cartpole_dropout_dnn_test.py"
-- The trained model can be changed by changing PATH variable in the "cartpole_dropout_dnn_test.py".

B. DEEP ENSEMBLES METHOD
-- Access the "Deep_Ensembles_Method" Folder.
-- To see the DNN Class for deep ensembles, open "deep_ensembles_nn.py".
-- To run the trained model, open and run "deep_ensembles_test.py"
-- The trained model is imported by changing PATH variable in the "deep_ensembles_test.py"
-- The NN ensemble is trained and exported in "ok_deep_ensembes_new.ipynb".

C. TRAINING DATA
The training data of the inputs and outputs generated from the cartpole simulator is stored in the "Training Data" folder
